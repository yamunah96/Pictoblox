- 📊 **Machine Learning (ML)**: ML models for classification, regression, and clustering, trained within PictoBlox.
- 💬 **ChatGPT-like NLP**: Natural language processing projects, including chatbots and text analysis.
- 🌐 **Internet of Things (IoT)**: IoT projects connecting sensors and devices for smart applications.
- 📝 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Advanced text processing and language understanding projects.
- 🤖 **Robotics**: Projects controlling robots and automating tasks using PictoBlox's robotics integrations.

## Getting Started
To run these projects, you need:
- 🛠️ **PictoBlox Software**: Download and install [PictoBlox](https://thestempedia.com/product/pictoblox/).
- 🐍 **Python Environment**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed for scripting.
- 🔌 **Hardware (Optional)**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or robotics kits (e.g., evive, Quarky) for specific projects.
- 📦 **Dependencies**: Install Python libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `opencv-python`) as specified in project documentation.

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pictoblox-projects.git
   ```
2. Open PictoBlox and load `.sb3` (block-based) or `.py` (Python) files from project folders.
3. Follow project-specific instructions in each folder’s `README.md`.
